            Hi! My name is Lodewijk "Lou" Brand and I have spent the past four 
            years working in the MInDS@Mines Lab directed by Dr. Hua Wang. 
            My research is centered on the development of scalable machine learning algorithms applied 
            to problems in bioinformatics with a focus on problems involving multi-modal and multi-instance data. 
            I have applied my research to identify which genetic variants and regions of the brain contribute to a future 
            diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. When I'm not in the lab, I spend the majority of my time rock-climbing outside.

            Hello there! I'm Professor Daniel Pittman, 
            an Associate Professor of the Practice in Software Development and Architecture 
            in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Denver (DU). 
            I worked in the software industry for 13 years, most recently as a principal software architect at 
            Comcast, and have just recently started a full-time position at DU. Since joining DU, I have taught 
            Web Programming I, Web Programming II, Web Programming III (Web Projects), NoSQL Databases, Computer Forensics, 
            and Machine Learning.

            Hi! My name is Grace, and I'm from Austin, Texas. 
            I first was introduced to Computer Science in high school through Girls Who Code, 
            and I'm now studying CS as a junior at Colorado School of Mines. I work as a mentor and lead TA 
            for our Intro to Computer Science course to support students new to college. I'm also an instructor for DECtech, 
            which is a camp at Mines for K-12 girls interested in STEM! I love CS because it allows me to be very creative and think in different ways.
