# ChenEatsFood
A personal project website showcasing all the cooking recipes and food ratings I've garnered over the last couple of years. A great reference for Sichuan
recipes! Accessible at this link [ChenEatsFood](https://cheneatsfood-edd88e267a86.herokuapp.com/cookbook). 

## Compiling the Website Locally 
Clone the repository and run the command ```flask run``` to run the site locally. Upon termination, locally stored items in the cookbook will be deleted. 

## Exploring the Website 
The primary components of the website include the Home page, Cookbook page, Reviews page, and Instagram page. The Create page is currently disabled; however, 
you can access it at ```/root/createrecipe``` to add an additional recipe to the cookbook.
