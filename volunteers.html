<h3>
    Apply to be a volunteer today!
</h3>
<p>
    Applications are currently open for those interested in volunteering for the summer of 2022. 
    <BR>
    As a volunteer, you will work closely with mentors in teaching students the material. 
    Volunteers are selected on a year by year basis, and two volunteers are selected per session. 
    <BR>
    While volunteers do not directly teach the entire camp, they are in charge of each group assigned to them. 
    Volunteers work one-on-one with students at the camps, so strong communication skills, a passion for code, 
    and enthusiasm is necessary! Take a look at our past volunteers above!
